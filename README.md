# RF_SIGNAL_CLASSIFCATION

## Explination
### Signal Classification Project
This project aims to classify Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The project is organized into several Python scripts for modularity and ease of understanding.

### File Structure
* utils.py: Contains utility functions for signal generation, feature extraction, and signal classification.
* fsk_signal.py: Generates FSK signals and extracts their features.
* ofdm_signal.py: Generates OFDM signals and extracts their features.
* classify_signal.py: Classifies the signals based on extracted features.
* main.py: Main script to run the entire process.

## How to run 
```
python2 main.py
```
